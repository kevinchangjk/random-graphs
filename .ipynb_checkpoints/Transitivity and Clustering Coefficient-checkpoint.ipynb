    "# Comparing Transitivity and Clustering Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitivity and Clustering Coefficient are both measures used to quantify the clustering of graphs and networks. Transitivity is the ratio of closed triangles in a network divided by the number of paths of length 2, and is thus the probability that if two nodes are connected separately to a common node, the two nodes are also connected. Clustering coefficient is the mean of the local clustering coefficients, which is calculated by dividing the number of existing edges between the neighbouring nodes of a node, and the total number of edges that could be formed among them."
